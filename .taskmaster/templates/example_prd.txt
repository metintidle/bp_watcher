# Overview  
BPWatcher is a background GUI automation bot designed to silently interact with the Best Practice (BP) Windows application. It extracts basic patient contact information and sends it to a server without any visible UI or user awareness. This tool addresses the need for automated data extraction from legacy Windows applications that lack proper APIs.

# Core Features  
1. **Silent Background Operation**
   - Runs automatically at system boot via Windows Task Scheduler
   - Operates with no visible UI, tray icon, or window
   - Ensures users remain unaware of the automation process

2. **BP Application Automation**
   - Launches the Best Practice executable
   - Handles login with stored credentials
   - Navigates to relevant screens containing patient information
   - Simulates user interactions without visible UI

3. **Data Extraction**
   - Takes screenshots of regions containing patient contact information
   - Applies OCR to extract structured data (names, phone numbers)
   - Processes images to improve OCR accuracy
   - Filters to only capture essential contact details

4. **Data Synchronization**
   - Sends extracted data to a configured HTTPS endpoint
   - Formats data as JSON for easy processing
   - Implements secure transmission protocols
   - Provides optional local logging

# User Experience  
Since BPWatcher is designed to run without a UI, the primary "users" are:

1. **System Administrator**
   - Installs and configures the application
   - Sets up credentials and endpoint information
   - Monitors logs for proper operation
   - Receives minimal interaction points, primarily during setup

2. **Server/API Consumer**
   - Receives structured patient contact data
   - Processes information according to business needs
   - Expects consistent data format and reliable delivery

The UX focuses on zero visibility during operation with simple configuration during setup.

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
1. **Risk**: BP application updates may break automation
   **Mitigation**: 
   - Implement robust element detection that doesn't rely on exact positions
   - Add configuration options to adjust for UI changes
   - Create monitoring to detect and alert on automation failures

2. **Risk**: OCR accuracy may be insufficient for reliable data extraction
   **Mitigation**:

   - Add validation rules to verify extracted data format
   - Create fallback mechanisms for low-confidence extractions

3. **Risk**: Windows security features may block automation
   **Mitigation**:
   - Request appropriate permissions during installation
   - Implement alternative interaction methods if primary ones are blocked
   - Add detailed error reporting for permission issues

## MVP Scope Challenges
1. **Risk**: Initial version may be too complex to deliver quickly
   **Mitigation**:
   - Focus on core data extraction from a single screen first
   - Implement a phased approach with clear milestones
   - Create a minimal viable product that demonstrates value

2. **Risk**: Silent operation requirements may conflict with debugging needs
   **Mitigation**:
   - Implement a debug mode that can be enabled for troubleshooting
   - Create comprehensive logging that doesn't require UI
   - Develop remote diagnostics capabilities

## Resource Constraints
1. **Risk**: Application may consume excessive system resources
   **Mitigation**:
   - Optimize screenshot and OCR operations
   - Implement intelligent polling instead of continuous operation
   - Add resource monitoring and throttling capabilities

2. **Risk**: Development time may exceed expectations
   **Mitigation**:
   - Prioritize features based on core value delivery
   - Use existing libraries where possible instead of custom implementations
   - Create clear acceptance criteria for each development phase

# Appendix  
## OCR Optimization Techniques
- Grayscale conversion improves Tesseract accuracy by 15-20%
- Contrast enhancement significantly improves text extraction in BP's interface
- Region-specific OCR parameters can be tuned for different screen areas
- Text pattern matching can validate extracted data against expected formats

## BP Application Analysis
- Login screen appears consistently with same field positions
- Patient list screen has consistent column layout
- Contact information appears in predictable regions
- Application has consistent response times that can be used for reliable automation

## Security Considerations
- Credentials should be stored with Windows Data Protection API
- Only basic contact information is extracted, no clinical data
- All network communication must use TLS 1.2+
- No data should be stored locally except for logs

## Testing Strategy
- Automated tests should verify each component independently
- End-to-end tests should validate the complete workflow
- Performance testing should measure resource usage over extended periods
- Security testing should verify that no sensitive data is exposed
